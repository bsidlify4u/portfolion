# Portfolion Testing Infrastructure Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the Portfolion framework's testing infrastructure to make it more robust, reliable, and developer-friendly.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Dedicated Testing Environment
- Created a standardized testing environment configuration
- Implemented a `test_config/env.testing.php` file for testing-specific settings
- Set up automatic in-memory SQLite database for fast, isolated tests

### 2. Test Helper Classes
- Created `Tests\Helpers\TestEnvironment` utility class to:
  - Set up a consistent testing environment
  - Configure database connections for testing
  - Create test database tables and seed data
  - Provide mock implementations for external dependencies

### 3. Better Database Testing
- Updated `DatabaseTestCase` to automatically set up in-memory SQLite
- Prevented tests from being skipped due to database connection issues
- Implemented proper test table setup and teardown
- Added support for different database drivers in tests (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Fixed SQL syntax issues across different database drivers

### 4. Test Command
- Created a dedicated `test` console command for running tests
- Added support for:
  - Running specific test suites (`php portfolion test Unit`)
  - Filtering tests (`php portfolion test --filter=TestName`)
  - Generating code coverage reports (`php portfolion test --coverage`)
  - Better error reporting and handling of warnings

### 5. Improved Test Organization
- Organized tests into logical suites (Unit, Feature, Database, etc.)
- Created base test classes for each type of test
- Standardized test naming and structure

### 6. Mock Implementations
- Added mock implementations for external dependencies like Redis
- Ensured tests don't rely on external services
- Created in-memory implementations of core services

### 7. Comprehensive Documentation
- Created detailed testing documentation in `docs/TESTING.md`
- Added examples and best practices for writing tests
- Documented the testing infrastructure

## Current Status

- **Unit Tests**: All unit tests are passing successfully
- **Database Tests**: Basic database connection tests are working, but some advanced tests involving Schema and Model classes still need fixing
- **Feature Tests**: Need further development
- **Integration Tests**: Need further development

## Known Issues

1. Schema class has namespace conflicts with SchemaBuilder
2. Model tests are failing due to issues with the Schema class
3. Some database tests expect SQLite but the environment only has MySQL available

## Using the Testing Infrastructure

### Running Tests
Use the new test command to run tests:

```bash
php portfolion test              # Run all tests
php portfolion test Unit         # Run only unit tests
php portfolion test --filter=... # Run tests matching a filter
php portfolion test --coverage   # Generate code coverage report
```

### Writing Tests
Extend the appropriate base test class:

```php
use Tests\TestCase;                   // For basic tests
use Tests\Database\DatabaseTestCase;  // For database tests
use Tests\Feature\FeatureTestCase;    // For feature tests
```

### Setting Up Test Environment
Use the TestEnvironment helper:

```php
use Tests\Helpers\TestEnvironment;

// In your test setup
TestEnvironment::setupTestConfig();
TestEnvironment::setupDatabaseForTesting();
```

## Best Practices
1. Use in-memory SQLite for database tests when possible, or adapt to MySQL when necessary
2. Mock external dependencies
3. Isolate tests from each other
4. Clean up after tests
5. Test both normal and edge cases
6. Don't skip tests; fix underlying issues
7. Keep tests fast and focused
