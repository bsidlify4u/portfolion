# Portfolion Framework Test Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of running the test suite for the Portfolion Framework, particularly focusing on the database functionality across different database engines.

## Test Execution

The tests were executed using PHPUnit with the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Test Results

### Summary
- Total Tests: 32
- Passed Tests: 22
- Failed Tests: 1
- Error Tests: 9

### Issues Found

#### 1. Model Issues

1. **Boolean Casting Issue**
   - Error: `Incorrect integer value: '' for column 'active' at row 1`
   - Location: `Tests\Database\ModelTest::testWhere`
   - Description: The framework is having issues with empty values for boolean fields. When a boolean field is set to `false` or an empty string, it's not properly casting to the correct SQL value.

2. **Missing PHPUnit Method**
   - Error: `Call to undefined method Tests\Database\ModelTest::assertObjectNotHasAttribute()`
   - Location: `Tests\Database\ModelTest::testMassAssignmentProtection`
   - Description: The test is using a PHPUnit assertion method that doesn't exist in the current version. This should be replaced with a different assertion method.

#### 2. QueryBuilder Issues

1. **Missing Methods**
   - Several methods referenced in tests are not implemented in the QueryBuilder class:
     - `select()`
     - `orderBy()`
     - `count()`
     - `join()`
   - These methods need to be implemented to support the fluent query building interface.

2. **Parameter Binding Issue**
   - Error: `SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number`
   - Location: `Tests\Database\QueryBuilderTest::testUpdate`
   - Description: There's an issue with parameter binding in the update method. The number of parameters in the query doesn't match the number of values being bound.

3. **Return Value Type Issue**
   - Error: `Failed asserting that true is of type numeric.`
   - Location: `Tests\Database\QueryBuilderTest::testInsert`
   - Description: The `insert()` method is returning a boolean value instead of the last insert ID as expected.

## Recommendations

Based on the test results, the following improvements are recommended:

1. **Model Improvements**
   - Fix the boolean casting to properly handle `false` values and empty strings.
   - Update the mass assignment protection test to use a valid PHPUnit assertion method.

2. **QueryBuilder Enhancements**
   - Implement the missing methods (`select()`, `orderBy()`, `count()`, `join()`) to support fluent query building.
   - Fix the parameter binding issue in the `update()` method.
   - Update the `insert()` method to return the last insert ID instead of a boolean value.

3. **Database Engine Support**
   - The tests show that the framework is currently using MySQL with some SQLite compatibility.
   - Continue enhancing the framework to support all six database engines (MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2).

## Next Steps

1. Fix the identified issues in the framework code.
2. Update the tests to match the actual implementation where necessary.
3. Add more comprehensive tests for each database engine.
4. Create a continuous integration pipeline to automatically run tests against different database engines.
